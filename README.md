# Network Fundamental DHCP, PAT and NAT pool Set Up (Cisco Packet Tracer - For study purpose only)
Here in this project i will configure a network for an organization with multiple departments: IT, Finance, HR, Logistic and Marketing, where all users in the department receive appropriate dynamic IP address from a DHCP Server and setting up some security network inside IP and  outside IP. These designs can be expanded to create very complex architectures depending on the network requirements.

## How to Run
Install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) and then simply open the [dhcp_conf.pkt](https://github.com/weixiong15/Network_Fundamental_DHCP/blob/master/dhcp_conf.pkt). The whole network is in working condition. You can check it by sending a packet from one system to another or through using the PING command in the Cisco Packet Tracer.

**All Router and Switch passwords: cisco**

This solution works for version 6.2 or above of Cisco Packet Tracer.
